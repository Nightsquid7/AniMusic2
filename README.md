# AniMusic2

## What does this project do?
This is an iOS app to make it easier to listen to anime music. It's built around the fact that a lot of anime music fans want to listen to anime music by opening and ending for a given anime. So you can browse the music for a given anime, and open links to the different openings in Spotify (if our scraper found spotify song info), or open the song in Youtube or Google Play.
## Why is this project useful?
There are currently no iOS apps that organize anime music in this intuitive way.
