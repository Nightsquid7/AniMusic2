# AniMusic2
## On the App Store

* I had to remove Spotify and Youtube features to get the app approved for the App Store. I'm planning on re-adding them in a future release

## What does this project do?
This is an iOS app to make it easier to listen to anime music. It's built around the fact that a lot of anime music fans want to listen to anime music by opening and ending for a given anime. So you can browse the music for a given anime, and open links to the different openings in Spotify (if our scraper found spotify song info), or open the song in Youtube.
## Why is this project useful?
There are currently no iOS apps that organize anime music in this intuitive way. 
## How do I get started?
If you have a feature request, feel free to send a pull request or file an issue. 
## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
Create an issue, or tweet at @AniMusiciOS on twitter.
